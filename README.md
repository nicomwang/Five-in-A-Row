# Five-in-A-Row
Computer Networking Final Project

## About The Project
* Five in A Row(Gomoku) is an abstract strategy board. It is traditionally played with black and white stones on a board, using 15x15 grid intersections.  
* We developed a two-player Gomoku Game using client-server architecture. 
* Rules: Two clients connect to the server to join a game. Players (clients) alternate turns to place a stone of their color on an empty intersection. The winner is the first one to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
